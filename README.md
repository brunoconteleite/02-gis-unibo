## Overview

This is a master/Ph.D. course on basic theory and tools for using spatial data in economic research.

All practical applications are taking place in ``R`` and ``RStudio``. **Please have both installed in your computer** before starting the course.

## Course structure

This is a 15 hours course, divided in five sessions of 3 hours. Its overall structure follows:

* **Session 1:** Introduction to spatial data and data wrangling in R
  * Basic aspects of `R` (`data.table`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`), spatial data, and applications in economic research
  
  * Class slides in **[html](https://brunoconteleite.github.io/02-gis-unibo/00_class01.html)** and **[pdf](https://brunoconteleite.github.io/02-gis-unibo/00_class01.pdf)**
  
  * Hands-in material **[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gyjmlxnqk24u312/01_class01.R?dl=1)**

* **Session 2:** Vector spatial data (points, lines, and polygons)
  * Loading and manipulating with ``sf``. Basic principles of spatial (re)projections. Basic attribute data operations (e.g. ``filter()``, ``slice()``) with ``data.table`` and data  visualization with ``ggplot2``
  
  * *Assignment:* replicating maps spatial summary statistics from academic papers. Instructions here
  
  * Class slides here
  
  * Hands-in material here

* **Session 3:** Spatial data operations with vector data
  * Spatial Subsetting and topological relations (e.g. ``st_intersects()``, ``st_overlaps()``, ``st_touches()``), spatial joining and aggregation (e.g. ``st_join()``, ``aggregate()``), and calculating distances (and spatial networks) with ``gdistance``, ``rgeos``, and ``igraph``
  
  * *Assignment:* reproducing operations with proposed data and replicating results from academic papers. Instructions here
  
  * Class slides here
  
  * Hands-in material here
  
* **Session 4:** Spatial geometry operations and miscelania
  * Basic operations with vector data (e.g. centroids, shift, rotate, buffering)
  
  * Time allowing: Reporting data work with `R`: a short introduction to `rmarkdown`
  
  * *Class follow-up:* feedback on course pace, reinforcing concepts, etc.
  
  * Class slides here
  
  * Hands-in material here

* **Session 5:** Raster data
  * Loading and manipulating raster data with ``terra``. Basic raster operations (e.g. ``resample``, ``stack``, ``brick``, ``crop``)
  
  * Managing curse of dimensionality and large disk and memory needs for dealing with raster data
  
  * Raster-vector operations with ``terra`` and ``exactextractr`` (e.g. extracting, rasterizing, vectorizing, zonal statistics)
  * *Conclusion:* follow-up on important concepts and (potentially) holding short presentations of research projects
  
  * *Assignment:* replication of results and spatial statistics from academic papers. Instructions here
  
  * Class slides here
  
  * Hands-in material here
